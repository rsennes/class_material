The first matches a capitalized first letter followed by a series of lowercase characters, an optional space, and then another capitalized first letter and series of lowercase characters (essentially two capitalized words optionally separated by a space). The second expression simply matches a single capitalized word, and the OR operator in between them specifies that one or the other should be returned if matched. You can see that the results are formatted as a list of tuples where the result is positioned as the first element if it matches the first grouped expression and the second element if it matches the second grouped expression.\n","\n","If you didn't care for the nested structure and just wanted a single neat list with the results, you could use a list comprehension to obtain that as follows."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5d8BCQSgWYzl","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"0820fa7e-6da5-47e6-d3f6-8b7582f37422"},"source":["results = [i for j in re.findall(pattern, text) for i in j if i != '']\n","results"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['TerraPower', 'Bill Gates', 'China', 'Trump']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":89}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vgbHmKdrWYzv","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"94de23bb-a2e1-4224-d348-30f26041b78c"},"source":["list(filter(lambda x : x != '', [j for j in re.findall(pattern,text)]))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Terra', 'Power', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'China', 'Trump']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":117}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6ruCv9zNWYz0","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"5f6afb81-0df8-45b1-99b1-3c3490593162"},"source":["[i for j in re.findall(pattern,text) for i in j]"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['TerraPower', '', 'Bill Gates', '', '', 'China', '', 'Trump']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":95}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FalgxcX3WYz6","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"8d2d8c22-7789-48f5-d5f1-1c2a7fba0fbc"},"source":["[i for j in re.findall(pattern,text) for i in j if i != '']"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['TerraPower', 'Bill Gates', 'China', 'Trump']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":96}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Y11LwzzWWYz_","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"B9egz44PWY0C","colab_type":"text"},"source":["You can see that this gets us part of the way toward what is known as Named Entity Recognition, which involves the extraction of proper nouns (names of people, places, things, etc.) from a body of text.

This is beyond the scope of this lesson, but we will provide some coverage in a future lesson.\n","### Extracting Quotes from Text\n","\n","Another useful application of regular expressions is extracting quotes from text. It is relatively straightforward to do this. We simply need to match all characters within a set of quotes in the text.

This means they match as much text as they possibly can while allowing the entire pattern to match successfully.\n","### Extracting Formatted Numbers\n","\n","The last set example we will look at in this lesson shows how regular expressions can be used for extracting formatted numbers from a body of text.
